<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodenticide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants Rodenticides</li><li>Non-anticoagulants Rodenticides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rodenticide market is primarily divided into two types: anticoagulants and non-anticoagulants. Anticoagulant rodenticides disrupt the blood clotting process in rodents, resulting in death after several days of consumption. Examples include bromadiolone and brodifacoum. Non-anticoagulant rodenticides, on the other hand, provide a quicker kill, often targeting the nervous system or causing dehydration. These include active ingredients such as bromethalin and zinc phosphide. Each type is utilized based on specific pest control needs and environmental considerations.</p></p>
